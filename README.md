# Remove_trailing_zeros_from_Integer_data_cleaning

## Problem Statement
Numbers ending with zeros are boring.

They might be fun in your world, but not here.

Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.

Examples:
- 1450 -> 145
- 960000 -> 96
- 1050 -> 105
- -1050 -> -105

Zero alone is fine, don't worry about it. Poor guy anyway.

## Solution Concept
The `NoBoring` class contains a method `noBoringZeros` that removes trailing zeros from an integer. If the number is zero, it remains unchanged. This method effectively manipulates the integer as a string to identify and eliminate the trailing zeros before converting it back to an integer.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to manipulate strings and integers in Java.
- Learn the practical application of string manipulation and mathematical operations.
- Enhance debugging skills through the provided `System.out.println()` statements to track the internal state and computation values step-by-step.

## Practical Applications
This exercise is particularly useful in fields where data needs to be presented in its simplest form without unnecessary formatting:
- Data cleaning in software development.
- Preprocessing data in machine learning and data science to ensure numeric values are in a uniform format.
- Financial systems where trailing zeros can be misleading in reports and summaries.

## Algorithm Details
1. Convert the integer to a string to examine its characters.
2. Iterate over the string from right to left to count the trailing zeros.
3. Use the count of zeros to calculate the factor of ten to divide the original number.
4. Divide the integer by this factor to remove the trailing zeros.
5. Return the processed number.
